SQL INTRODUCTION

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a standardized way to communicate with databases, allowing users to perform various operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.

SQL is primarily used to interact with relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and SQLite. It is a declarative language, meaning you specify what you want to accomplish, and the database management system figures out how to do it.

SQL operates through a set of commands or statements, which can be categorized into four main types:

Data Definition Language (DDL): These statements are used to define and manage the structure of the database. Examples include creating tables, altering table structures, and defining constraints.

Data Manipulation Language (DML): DML statements are used to interact with the data within the database. They include commands like SELECT (retrieve data), INSERT (add data), UPDATE (modify data), and DELETE (remove data).

Data Control Language (DCL): DCL statements deal with the security and permissions of the database. They allow users to grant or revoke privileges to access and manipulate data, such as GRANT and REVOKE.

Data Query Language (DQL): DQL statements are focused on querying and retrieving data from the database. The most commonly used DQL statement is SELECT, which allows you to specify criteria for retrieving specific data from tables.

SQL provides powerful features for managing and querying data, enabling efficient data management, data retrieval, and data manipulation in a structured manner. It is widely used in various applications and industries that rely on relational databases for storing and retrieving data
