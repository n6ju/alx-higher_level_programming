Python supports a variety of data structures that can be used to organize and store data. Some of the commonly used data structures in Python are:

Lists: Lists are ordered collections of elements that can be of any type. They are mutable, which means that you can add, remove, or modify elements in a list.

Tuples: Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, which means that once you create a tuple, you cannot change its contents.

Sets: Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are mutable, which means that you can add or remove elements from a set.

Dictionaries: Dictionaries are key-value pairs where each key is unique and is used to retrieve the corresponding value. They are mutable, which means that you can add or remove key-value pairs from a dictionary.

Arrays: Arrays are used to store a collection of items of the same data type. They are similar to lists, but they are more efficient when it comes to performing mathematical operations.

Linked lists: Linked lists are a type of data structure that consists of a series of nodes, each containing a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

Stacks: Stacks are a type of data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. They can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

Queues: Queues are a type of data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. They can also be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
